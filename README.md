# BookMarkdown

A simple script which can convert brower bookmarks(_a HTML file_) into a Markdown file (also support JSON).

## Usage

``` Python
python3 convert.py -i bookmarks.html -o bookmarks.md
```

## To-do

- [ ] Different dirs with the same name should be placed into different places
- [ ] Currently, folders must be placed before bookmarks, and the conversion should be processed to be order-independent.
